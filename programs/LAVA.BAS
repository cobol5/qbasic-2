'
' LAVA.BAS was written to take advantage of an effect I had seen in my earlier
'screen savers. When you issue a PAINT statement on a graphic that is linked
'by small lines, the color crawls along the lines until the edges are reached
'or all the pixels have changed to the new color. This program draws a screen
'full of circles and colored pixels and issues random PAINT statements to
'random points on the screen. Occasionally these points are linked to large
'areas and the color "crawls" across the screen. Like a lava lamp it takes
'awhile it to warm up (for the screen to fill with circles).
'As a screen saver it may not be ideal as some of the PAINT statements take
'awhile to complete before the program surrenders control.
